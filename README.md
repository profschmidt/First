###  What is MarkDown?

Well, we have *italics*, and **bold**, and we can sure as ~~shit~~ taxes do

Oh, and vim knows MarkDown.  How nice.

####  We have Lists

* Something
* Something else
	* Sub-something else
	* Sub-something else else

1. Something
2. Something else
	1. Sub-something else
	2. Sub-something else else

####  Links
